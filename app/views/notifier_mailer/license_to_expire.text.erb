Dear <%= @license.first_name %>,

This is a courtesy reminder that your license for Appliance ID: <%= @license.appliance_id %> expires after <%= @license.valid_date.strftime('%A, %B %d, %Y') %>. Once the license is expired, your OntoPortal Appliance will cease to operate.

Please follow the link below to our license server to apply for a new license:

<%= root_url %>

Note that the approval process normally takes 24 to 48 hours, so please apply at your earliest opportunity.

We will send you your new license key once your renewal application is approved. You will need to re-enter it by logging in to your OntoPortal Appliance Administration Console.

Sincerely,

The OntoPortal Team
