Dear <%= @license.first_name %>,

This is a courtesy reminder that your OntoPortal license for Appliance ID: <%= @license.appliance_id %> expires after <%= @license.valid_date.strftime('%A, %B %d, %Y') %>. Once the license is expired, your OntoPortal Appliance will cease to operate.

Please follow the link below to our license server to apply for a new license:

For non-profit, government, and educational organizations, the approval process normally takes less than 1 business day. For commercial organizations, we will contact you to complete the licensing process.

We will send you your new license key once your renewal application is approved. You will need to re-enter it by logging in to your OntoPortal Appliance Administration Console.

Sincerely,

The OntoPortal Team
