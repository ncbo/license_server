<p>Dear <%= @license.first_name %>,</p>
<p>This is a courtesy reminder that your OntoPortal license for Appliance ID: <%= @license.appliance_id %> expires after <span style="color:#ba3329;font-weight:bold"><%= @license.valid_date.strftime('%A, %B %d, %Y') %></span>. Once the license is expired, your OntoPortal Appliance will cease to operate.</p>
<p>Please follow the link below to our license server to apply for a new license:<br/><br/>
  <a href="<%= root_url %>"><%= root_url %></a><br/><br/>
  For non-profit, government, and educational organizations, the approval process normally takes less than 1 business day. For commercial organizations, we will contact you to complete the licensing process.</p>
<p>We will send you your new license key once your renewal application is approved. You will need to re-enter it by logging in to your OntoPortal Appliance Administration Console.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The OntoPortal Team</p>
